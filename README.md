These scripts automate the process of exporting all variations of an InDesign file with conditional text.

- `export-all-conditions.js` can be used to export all conditions of the currently open file. 
- `export-all-docs-all-conditions.js` can be used to export every conditional variation of each file in a folder. When running this script, you will be prompted to select a folder.

To use these scripts (on a mac).

1. Open InDesign.
2. Select `Window > Scripts` to open the scripts window.
3. Right click on the `User` folder and select `reveal in finder`.
4. Copy the scripts into this folder in finder. The scripts can now be run in InDesign.
5. Then, double click on the required script within the Scripts window in Indesign.
